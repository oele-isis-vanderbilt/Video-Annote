# video-annote

**Minimum Python:** `>=3.10`

**video-annote** is a lightweight **multi-video annotation tool** (PyQt5) for labeling time ranges (“labels”) while reviewing one or more videos.

## Quick install

For a fast setup, use Conda:

```bash
conda create -n video-annote python=3.10 -y
conda activate video-annote
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg -y
pip install video-annote
python -m video_annote
```

This installs Python, `ffmpeg/ffprobe`, and `video-annote` in one environment.

---

You can:
- Create/import sessions that contain multiple videos (local files or URLs)
- Choose a **Time Source** (master timeline) and an **Audio Source**
- Play/pause/restart and scrub safely
- Mark **start/end** for labels and save annotations
- Review and edit annotations via a **timeline** and a **table**
- Autosave session state as you work
- Click **Finish Session** when you are done to reset the workspace for a new session; your work is already being saved on the fly

## Requirements

- **Python >= 3.10**
- **PyQt5**
- **ffmpeg + ffprobe**

### Why ffmpeg/ffprobe?
`video-annote` uses `ffmpeg/ffprobe` for:
- importing URL-based videos (including `.m3u8`)
- reading duration/FPS reliably

---

## Recommended: Conda environment setup

This is the most reproducible setup (and the easiest way to ensure ffmpeg/ffprobe are available).

### 1) Create and activate an environment

```bash
conda create -n video-annote python=3.10 -y
conda activate video-annote
```

### 2) Install ffmpeg (inside the env)

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg -y
```

> From here on, **run the remaining install/run steps inside this activated conda environment**.

---

## Install & run

Choose one of the following approaches.

### A) Install from PyPI (pip)

```bash
pip install video-annote
python -m video_annote
```

### B) Using uv (great for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Surya-Rayala/Video-Annote.git
cd Video-Annote
uv sync
uv run python -m video_annote
```

Notes:
- If you use **uv**, you can still use the system/conda-installed ffmpeg as long as it’s on PATH.
- If you created a **conda env**, make sure it’s activated before running uv commands so the env’s ffmpeg is used.

## How to use

### 1) Select a Data Root
Click **Select Root** and choose a folder where sessions will be stored.

### 2) Create or import a session
- **Create New Session**
  - Enter a session label (example: `session_001`)
  - Add videos:
    - **Local file…**
    - **URL…** (downloadable URL or `.m3u8` — requires ffmpeg)
- **Import Existing Session**
  - Loads an already-saved session from the Data Root

### 2.5) Finish a session when you are done
- Click **Finish Session** to reset/clear the current workspace after completing a session
- Your annotations and session changes are already autosaved as you work, so **Finish Session** is mainly for wrapping up and starting fresh

### 3) Choose which videos are visible
Use **Selected videos** (multi-select) to choose which videos appear in the grid.

### 4) Pick Time Source and Audio Source
- **Time Source** = master timeline used for the slider and annotation timestamps
- **Audio Source** = which video provides sound

> Other videos are kept aligned to the Time Source during playback when possible.
> If a video is shorter than the current Time Source position, its cell may show black.

### 5) Playback and scrubbing
- **Play / Pause / Restart**
- Drag the timeline slider to seek
- Play is disabled at the end of the Time Source (use Restart)

> **Note on playback smoothness:** On some machines (or when the system is under heavy load), video playback may feel choppy and/or audio may stutter. If that happens, click **Restart** or nudge the timeline slider slightly **forward or backward** to help playback re-sync and settle.

## Creating annotations (label workflow)

### 1) Create Labels
On the right panel (**Labels**):
- Add label number + name (example: `1: Label1`, `2: Label2`, …)
- Each label is assigned a stable color

### 2) Start a label
- Select a label
- Click **Start**
- Move the playhead to where the label begins
- Click **Confirm Start**

### 3) End and save
- Play forward (or scrub) to where the label ends
- Click **End**
- Adjust the end position if needed
- Click **Confirm End** to save (confidence + notes)

This saves an **annotation** for that label.

---

## Timeline & table (review + editing)

### Timeline
The timeline shows all labels as colored blocks:
- Click a block to view details
- Edit to adjust start/end (drag handles)

### Table
The table shows every annotation row:
- Derived fields are locked for safety
- Only key fields can be edited (start/end time, label number, confidence, notes)

---

## Running from Python (advanced)

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
from video_annote.main_window import MainWindow

app = QApplication([])
w = MainWindow()
w.show()
app.exec_()
```

---

## Troubleshooting


### Playback feels choppy or audio stutters
On some systems, playback smoothness depends on your computer’s performance and current load. If video or audio becomes unstable:
- Click **Restart**, or
- Move the timeline slider slightly **forward or backward** to let playback re-sync.

### Playhead jumps back to the start near the end (known issue)
Sometimes, after reaching the end of the **Time Source**, playback may jump back to **00:00**.  This usually happens while labeling (after **Confirm Start** or after clicking **End**), **Confirm End** may not save because the end time becomes earlier than the start time.

**Fix:** drag the timeline slider to the desired label end time (away from the start time), then click **Confirm End** again.


### When should I click Finish Session?
Use **Finish Session** after you are done annotating and want to reset the UI/workspace before starting another session. You do **not** need it to save your work — session data and annotations are saved automatically as you work.
